# House-Price-Prediction-Model
I am thrilled to present my House Price Prediction Model, developed to predict house prices based on various features in a comprehensive dataset. This project has been a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to dive deep into data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and deployment.

Project Highlights:
Data Exploration: Analyzed a comprehensive dataset of house features and sale prices to gain insights into the data.
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Feature Engineering:
Extracted meaningful insights to enhance model performance and predictive power.
Model Development:
Implemented and evaluated various machine learning algorithms, ultimately achieving the best performance with the Gradient Boosting Regressor, which provided an accuracy score of 0.013.
Visualization: 
Created engaging visualizations to interpret model predictions and feature importance effectively.
Deployment: 
Successfully deployed the model to provide real-time house price predictions.
Tools & Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Development Environment: 
Jupyter Notebook
This project was both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to enhance my skills and knowledge in data science and machine learning. I invite you to check out my repository and share your thoughts!
